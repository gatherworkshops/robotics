      ## Say hi to your mentors!

      Your mentors are here to help if you get stuck,
      and you can ask them (almost) anything!

    notes: |

      Your mentors are super friendly, make sure to say hi.

      They actually get paid to do this stuff for a job, which is super cool.

      You can ask them for help with your code, ask them about their day job, or ask them what their favourite colour is.

      They're here to help, so ask them anything :)

      ## Schedule

      **3D Printing**

      _Morning Break_

      **Robotics Intro**

      _Lunch Break_

      **Robotics Programming**

    notes: |

      Today's workshop is arranged in six different sections.

      In the first part we will look at basic motion and features, and also try out some programs and do a few challenges. 

      After that we will move on to more difficult stuff like sensors and control statements you can use.

      Later we will program with remote controls and use ultrasonic sensors, yay!

      ## Install apple Driver

      Make sure to install this driver so your computer can talk to your mBot. 
      If your computer asks to restart then do it now

      [Download link](http://blog.sengotta.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/CH34x_Install.zip){: target="_blank"}

      ## Connect mBot

      - ![Instruction 1]([[BASE_URL]]/media/images/slidecontent/instructions3.jpg){: height="200" width="300"}
        Plug cable in.
      - ![Instruction 2]([[BASE_URL]]/media/images/slidecontent/onbutton.jpg){: height="200" width="300"}
        Turn robot on.
      - ![Instruction 3]([[BASE_URL]]/media/images/slidecontent/instructions2.jpg){: height="200" width="300"}
