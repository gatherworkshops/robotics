    notes: |

      Some of you who have experience with programming may have already used them.
      You can actually use these statements with robots too

      ## If Statement
      
      "If statements" are just like making the right decision. 
      **If** it is raining **then** open your umbrella.  
    notes: |

      Ask students to come up with their own if statements.

      ## Operators
      ![Basic Motions]([[BASE_URL]]/media/images/slidecontent/operators.jpg){: height="250" width="400"}
      Operators are used to make comparisons.
      Eg: if(age < 18) then you are underage.   
    notes: |

      Use any other examples for operators. if(area_code == 09) then you're calling auckland
      Degree is a variable. Can anyone tell me what a variable is? Variables are words/number that are stored for later usage.
      In some causes you would have to declare your variable(let your program know what it is equal to).
      EG: degree = 45;
      if(degree > 40) then its freaking hot.
      However in your robot, you would not have to declare the temperature, your program already knows the temperature number from the sensor.
      These operators are relational operators(check relation between two variables)
      There are other operators which some of you may have already done such as bitwise, logical, etc.

      ## Timer
      ![Control commands]([[BASE_URL]]/media/images/slidecontent/timer if.jpg){: height="250" width="400"}
      This is an example of an **If** statement. 
      The **timer** block counts the time from the start of your program. 
      What happens in this program?
      Try this yourself.

    notes: |

      Timer starts from 0 seconds at the start of your program.

      ## If/Else
      ![Control commands]([[BASE_URL]]/media/images/slidecontent/ifelse.jpg){: height="250" width="400"}
      Else can also be used in your if statement.
      **If** traffic light is green, go **Else**(otherwise), stop.

      ## If/Else
      ![Control commands]([[BASE_URL]]/media/images/slidecontent/timerelse.jpg){: height="250" width="400"}
      Using an **if/else** statement with **timer**
      What happens in this program?
      Try this yourself.
