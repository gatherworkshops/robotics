      ## Self driving robots?!
      
      Yes, you can create a self driving robot with your own mBot
      using a ultrasonic sensor. How exciting!

    notes: |

      You can program your mbot to never crash into a wall or anything by using ultrasonic sensors.
      Who has seen one of those robot vacumn cleaners?
      Does anyone know what ultrasonic sensor might do?
      Ultrasonic sensors generate sound waves and evaluate the echo which is received back by the sensor
      measuring the time interval between sending the signal and receiving the echo to determine the distance to an object.

      ## Hmmm
      ![Thinking]([[BASE_URL]]/media/images/slidecontent/thinking.gif)
      Have a think about statements/commands that would be used.
      Googling is encouraged. 
    notes: |

      If/else, forever loop, ultrasonic sensor, and operators.
