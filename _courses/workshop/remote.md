      # Remote Control Programming
      

    notes: |

      In this chapter you're going to learn how to program your remote control to do as you want!

      This workshop is designed to introduce you to the basics of writing programs for robots.

      By the end of the workshop you will have programmed a robot to do cool things!

      ## Remote Control
      ![Remote]([[BASE_URL]]/media/images/slidecontent/remote3.jpg){: height="300" width="270"}
      This is your robot remote control.
      You can program the buttons to do anything you like.
       
    notes: |

      Describe features of the remote and how you might be able to program functions to it.

      ## Remote Buttons
      ![Control commands]([[BASE_URL]]/media/images/slidecontent/remote1.jpg){: height="300" width="450"}
      The IR Remote block allows you to react to button presses.
      You can simply program it to do something when **A** is pressed.

    notes: |
      Explain how you can program your robot to do as you want when you press a certain button.

      ## Example 

      ![Remote Instruction]([[BASE_URL]]/media/images/slidecontent/remote2.jpg){: height="250"}
      When **A** is pressed robot lights come on. 
      Try it out yourself!
    notes: |

      Explain how any button can be programmed to do something, eg: drive forwards, play a tune, set all lights on. Any questions?

      ## Challenge

      Program your robot to move using your remote as a controller. 
      Your robot should be able to go forwards, backwards, right, left and stop.
    notes: |

      Now program your robot to do these motions by using your remote. Complete the same maze as before.
      If there is time left at the end, get them to come up with a program idea and present it to the class. 
      However this program needs to be duable(not too hard), something they can program within an hour or so.
