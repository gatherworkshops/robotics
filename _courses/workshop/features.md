      There are more things you can do with your robot than just making it go forwards and turn

      ## Forever loop
      ![Forever Loop]([[BASE_URL]]/media/images/slidecontent/giphy.gif){: height="250" width="400"}
      What if you want your robot to drive forwards and turn right forever?
      Well... Until the battery dies.   
    notes: |

      In that case you would use a forever loop(also known as a while loop). This makes your program run repeat itself forever.
      A forever loop makes life a lot easier in terms of not having to write lots and lots of lines of code for repeated functions.

      ## Try it out
      ![Forever Loop]([[BASE_URL]]/media/images/slidecontent/forever.jpg){: height="250" width="400"}
      Try this program with your own robot.

      ## Repeat
      ![Repeat Loop]([[BASE_URL]]/media/images/slidecontent/giphy 2.gif){: height="250" width="400"}
      What about repeating just 3 times?
      

    notes: |
      How could you do this?

      ## Example
      ![Repeat Loop]([[BASE_URL]]/media/images/slidecontent/repeat.jpg){: height="250" width="400"}
      In this case you would use a repeat loop.
      Try this program.
      

    notes: |
      What does this program do?
      Instead of writing go forwards, turn right, go forwards turn right and so on... You can simply add in a repeat option! 
      The repeat loop is also known as a for loop, simply choose the amount of times you want your program to repeat.

      ## Mini challenge
  
      Do a figure 8 motion 3 times. 


    notes: |

      Do you remember how to use angles?

      ## Challenge: Create a maze & program your robot to finish it. 
      

      

    notes: |

      Use masking tape and create your own maze! Your aim is to finisht the maze with your robot without crashing. 
      Things to take note of: your starting position, figure out how many seconds it takes to make a 90 degree angle
      Tell them to choose a turning speed eg 100, do a 360 turn and time how long it takes for the full turn then divide by 4.
      Perferably a slower speed, it is easier to time it. 
      Is your masking tape in a perfect 90 degree angle?
      You may use measuring tape time taken = distance/speed
